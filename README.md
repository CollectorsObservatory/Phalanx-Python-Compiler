# Phalanx - A Python-Based Compiler for Arithmetic and Conditional Expressions

Phalanx is an ambitious project aimed at building a lightweight compiler in Python. It focuses on parsing and interpreting a subset of Python itself, specifically targeting arithmetic expressions, variable assignments, and conditional statements. Designed with simplicity and education in mind, Phalanx serves as a practical tool for understanding the basics of compiler design and execution environments.

## Features

- **Arithmetic Expression Evaluation**: Supports basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) for both integers and floating-point numbers.
- **Variable Assignments**: Allows for the assignment of values to variables, enhancing the capability to perform complex calculations and maintain state.
- **Conditional Statements**: Interprets basic conditional structures (`if`, `else`, `elif`), enabling decision-making within the code.
- **Tokenization**: Implements a robust tokenization process to accurately parse code into identifiable tokens.
- **Symbol Table Management**: Manages a symbol table to keep track of variable names and their values throughout the execution.
- **Logical Operations**: Supports logical operators (`and`, `or`) for more complex conditional statements.
- **Function Definitions and Calls**: Enables defining and calling functions, adding modularity and reuse to the code.
- **Extensible**: Designed to be easily extendable, allowing for further development and addition of new features.
